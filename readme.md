Mock up project of the image below.

My re-creation of the above image.

Toolkit:
Vanilla HTML5 / Vanilla CSS3 / jQuery / FontAwesome / Google Fonts

jQuery on the project is attached to the like(heart) counter on the top right. It is set up to add +1 to current value and
change the color of the heart to red.  Once clicked, it will not allow the user to continue to add to the like value.

Here is my mockup thus far:
